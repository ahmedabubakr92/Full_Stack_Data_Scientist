# Full Stack Data Scientist

The idea behind this whole repository would be to create a repository taking my data enthusiasts on a journey to becoming full stack data scientists. In this digital era, where data is growing exponentially and businesses are increasingly relying on data-driven decision-making, the role of a data scientist has become more critical than ever. Today, I invite you to join me as we explore the path to becoming a versatile data scientist capable of handling the entire data science tasks.

The Journey will be divided into several sections, each section will be from beginner to advanced level. The sections I’ll be covering and focusing on will be as follows:

- SQL for Data Science
- Python for Data Science
- Statistics for Data Science
- GitHub for Data Science
- AI Machine Learning
- AI Deep Learning
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- ML Cloud Deployment
- Hands-On Projects
- Microsoft Power BI

A special thanks to Bright Kyeremeh’s Full Stack Data Scientist Bootcamp on Udemy. As his course helped and inspired to start this journey.

Becoming a full stack data scientist requires a combination of technical skills, domain knowledge, and a passion for learning. As we embark on this learning journey together, we’ll gain expertise in mathematics, programming, data manipulation, machine learning, data visualization, and deployment. Remember, the key to success lies not only in acquiring knowledge but also in applying it to real-world problems. So let’s roll up our sleeves, dive deep into the world of data science, and unlock the limitless possibilities that lie ahead.
